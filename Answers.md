 1- Question One: Add New Feature
* I would recommend creating a News Channel directly from the Content area of their Staffbase Administrator login for the imaginary customer that wants to display their news on the app. Moreover, the Staffbase API provides interaction with the News section, in addition to utilizing the Staffbase GUI to manually create new Channels and Posts. Create new channels and publish new content using the API.

* The Staffbase technique for Automatic CSV Imports could very likely be utilized to automatically update the News portion of their app, not just for onboarding new users, if their preexisting system generates news daily and they do not want to manually update it each day. I'd assist them in setting up the Automatic CSV Import to create fresh articles to their New Channel or Channels automatically.
